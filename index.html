            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p class="p1">I'm currently a 1st-year Undergrad at MAIT, Delhi, pursuing my Bachelor's degree in CSE-AI&ML. <br>
                I am very enthusiastic about coding and like to spend time learning the technologies involved in it. <br>
                Fundamentally, I love solving problems, and am trying to get a good grip on them by solving problems through codes on the computer. Currently using "C" language.</p>

                <h3>Programming in C language</h3>
                <p class="p2">In the first semester of my college, I had, for the first time experienced the coding world.
                    Initially, it felt as if nothing made sense and I struggeled hard to give it a good start. 
                    <br>  <br> 
                    But its truly said that, "toughest part of any task is 'to get started' only!" <br> So once I nitro boosted myself and 
                    started coding, then there was no looking back. <br>
                    Since then, I have been consistently coding for most of the days, finished learning C language by none other than
                    "code with harry" and ended up getting the feel of why memory management is one of the most crucial part of a programme.
                    The concepts I learnt from there were:- 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Variables, Data types, Operators</li>
                        <li>Format Specifiers & Escape Sequences</li>
                        <li>Control statements: "if-else" "switch-case"</li>
                        <li>Loops: "do-while" "while" "for" </li>
                        <li>Use of "break" "continue" "goto" statements </li>
                        <li>TypeCasting</li>
                        <li>Functions</li>
                        <li>Recursions</li>
                        <li>Arrays</li>
                        <li>Pointers</li>
                    </ul>
                    And many other concepts. Click on link <a class="project" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9aiXlHcLx-mDH1Qul38wD3aR">HERE</a> to see the FULL content.

                <h3>Web_Development</h3>
                <p class="p3">See, we were the batch whose JEE exams had been shifted due to corona. So our session 
                    started only in NOVEMBER 2022. Hence to keep the course on track, the 1st semester was wrapped up by 
                    march 2023 (5 months duration). So after when our finals were over, me along with five friends of mine
                    decided to learn Full stack Web_Development through the 2nd semester. And hence bought this course 
                    by Angela Yu on "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp". Since then I have tried my level best 
                    to finish the course! But as WebDev requires a lot of practice, and due to other factors like hurried 
                    up course completition in college <b>(its 26th June 2023 and within 3 months, april-may-june, our 2nd Sem has also been wrapped up!)</b> 
                    I could not finish the course completely. But whatever I did, I did them very deligently, for sure!
                    So concepts I've learnt are:-
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML</li>
                        <li>CSS</li>
                        <li>CSS-flexbox</li>
                        <li>some BOOTSTRAP</li>
                        <li>JavaScript</li>
                        <li>currently learning:- React.js</li>
                    </ul>
                    So after learning the, React, my frontend learning journey will be completed, ofcourse, I won't be a pro by then! but I will be through with how a website's frontend works.
                    <br> <br> Thereafter, I am planning to start with Backend, also with DSA, in my summer vacations(only for name-sake! Tentative re-opening date: 1st August 2023) after my End-Term exams conclude on 13th July-2023!
                    <br> <br> 
                    Here are some of the projects of mine which I built as a practice, under Angela Yu's guidances in her course <a class="project" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">"The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp"</a>
                    They have a link, via GitHub:-
