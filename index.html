                Fundamentally, I love solving problems and am trying to get a good grip on them by solving problems
                through codes on the computer. Currently using "C/C++" language to solve problems on Leetcode and
                Codestudio!
                I am also learning full-stack web development and am in the frontend part of it right now, learnt HTML,
                CSS,
                JS and currently learning React.Js!
                I have recently also started working in the field of Data Science which is my branch only in B.Tech by
                the way! <br>
                So yeah!! Many things going on parallely! And I do hope to excel in them as per my hours of dedication

            <h4 id="lastUpdated">Last Updated :- 26th June 2023</h4>
            <p class="contentInPara">
                In the first semester of my college, I had, for the first time experienced the
                coding world.
                Initially, it felt as if nothing made sense and I struggeled hard to give it a good start.
                <br> <br>
                But its truly said that, "toughest part of any task is 'to get started' only!" <br> So once I nitro
                boosted myself and
                started coding, then there was no looking back. <br>
                Since then, I have been consistently coding for most of the days, finished learning C language by none
                other than
                "code with harry" and ended up getting the feel of why memory management is one of the most crucial part
                of a programme.
                <br>
                See, we were the batch whose JEE exams had been shifted due to corona. So our session
                started only in NOVEMBER 2022. Hence to keep the course on track, the 1st semester was wrapped up by
                march 2023 (5 months duration). So after when our finals were over, me along with five friends of mine
                decided to learn Full stack Web_Development through the 2nd semester. And hence bought this course
                by Angela Yu on "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp". Since then I have tried my level best
                to finish the course! But as WebDev requires a lot of practice, and due to other factors like hurried
                up course completition in college <b>(its 26th June 2023 and within 3 months, april-may-june, our 2nd
                    Sem has also been wrapped up!)</b>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="contentInPara">
                I could not finish the course completely. But whatever I did, I did them very deligently, for sure!
                So concepts I've learnt are:-
            <ul id="ulOfFrontendContent">
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>CSS-Flexbox & Grid</li>
                <li>some BOOTSTRAP</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>currently learning:- React.js</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="contentInPara">So after learning the, React, my frontend learning journey will be completed,
                ofcourse, I won't be a pro
                by
                then! but I will be through with how a website's frontend works.
                Thereafter, I am planning to start with Backend, also with DSA, in my summer vacations(only for
                name-sake! Tentative re-opening date: 1st August 2023) after my End-Term exams conclude on 13th
                July-2023!</p>

                Some New Update!!
                Its 24th August today when I am pushing this update!
                See, I thought that I mastered JavaScript from Angela Yu. But it was a misunderstanding. And I realized
                it
                when I went on to study React.
                See, the FUNDAMENTALS what they say is JavaScript Only!!! Upon it only all these FrameWorks are built.
                And
                if you are not making your findamentals strong then you are not goanna survive in this coding sector.
                Hence I started this series on JavaScript called "Chai aur JavaScript" by Hitesh Choudhary! And he's
                really
                awesome in teaching inDepth JavaScript.
                I've completed 36 lectures out of 50 till date, and made 3 more new Projects thus understanding the
                depth of
                JavaScript!
                Now I will be completing this series and then will be starting with React once more and also with DSA in
                C++, keeping the later in more pace!
                So guys, thanks for hearing me out! will meet soon! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜„ðŸ˜Š

                I have renovated this aboutMe website, or say my Portfolio website <b>of mine</b> completely!
                The design I was motivated by, was from a software developer named "Avinash", from his youtube channel GreatStack!
                <br>
                The only thing left is to make this website responsive for mobile phones, rest, for PCs, its nearly prefect from my side!
                <br> <br>
                <b><u><i>And now, I have a base ready to put on all of my works</i></u>ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜„ðŸ˜Š!!</b>
                <br> <br>

                problems on C++ concepts, not of DSA. But hopefully I will be able to solve DSA questions too, which atr from 11th Lecture in his playlist!!
