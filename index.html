            <p class="p1">I am currently a third year undergraduate student at Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology (MAIT), Delhi, pursuing a Bachelor of
                Technology in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine
                Learning. <br> <br> My passion lies in the field of coding, where I spend a significant part of my time
                learning and adopting new technologies. My approach to problem solving is deeply rooted in my love of
                coding, and I actively improve my skills by solving challenges on platforms like LeetCode and
                CodeStudio, primarily using the "C/C++" programming language. I am also in the process of expanding my knowledge in the field of full-stack web development. After mastering JavaScript, I am learning React.js.
                <br> <br>
                Essentially, I pursue multiple avenues of learning and growth and strive to excel in each through my
                unwavering commitment and enthusiasm. Your consideration of my journey would be greatly appreciated.

            <p class="contentInPara">
                During my first semester at college, I embarked on my journey into the world of coding. Initially, it
                was a perplexing experience, and I grappled with the challenges of getting started. However, as the
                saying goes, "the toughest part of any task is to get started." With a surge of determination, I pushed
                through the initial hurdles and began my coding endeavors. <br>

                From that point forward, coding became a consistent part of my daily routine. I diligently learned the C
                programming language, guided by the tutorials of "Code with Harry." This phase of learning granted me
                invaluable insights into the critical realm of memory management within a program.
                <br>
                My academic journey commenced later than usual due to the rescheduled JEE exams caused by the pandemic.
                Consequently, our first semester, which commenced in November 2022, was swiftly concluded by March 2023,
                spanning a mere five months. After completing our first-semester finals, I and a group of five friends
                decided to delve into the world of Full Stack Web Development during our second semester. To facilitate
                our learning, we enrolled in Angela Yu's "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp."
                <br>
                While I didn't manage to complete the entire course due to the demanding nature of web development and
                the accelerated pace of our college curriculum (our second semester concluded by June 26, 2023, within a
                three-month timeframe from April to June), I approached the course with utmost diligence. The concepts I
                diligently absorbed include:
            </p>
            <ul id="ulOfFrontendContent">
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>CSS-Flexbox & Grid</li>
                <li>some BOOTSTRAP</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>currently learning:- React.js</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p class="contentInPara">At present, I am engrossed in learning React.js. Upon mastering React, I will have
                achieved a comprehensive understanding of front-end development, recognizing that I may not yet be
                considered an expert, but I will grasp the intricacies of website front-end functionality. Subsequently,
                during my summer break (anticipated to commence on August 1, 2023, after the conclusion of my End-Term
                exams on July 13, 2023), I intend to delve into back-end development and further deepen my knowledge of
                Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

            <p class="contentInPara">
                As of August 24th, I have some new update to share regarding my ongoing coding journey. I had
                initially believed that I had a solid grasp of JavaScript after completing Angela Yu's course. However,
                I soon realized that I had misunderstood the importance of mastering JavaScript's fundamentals. It
                became evident to me that these fundamentals serve as the foundation upon which all these frameworks are
                constructed. Without a strong foundation, thriving in the coding sector is a challenging endeavor.
                <br>
                To rectify this, I embarked on a comprehensive JavaScript learning series titled "Chai aur JavaScript"
                by Hitesh Choudhary. Hitesh Choudhary's in-depth approach to teaching JavaScript has been immensely
                valuable. I have successfully completed 36 out of 50 lectures in this series and have created three
                additional projects, thereby gaining a profound understanding of the intricacies of JavaScript.
                My plan moving forward involves completing the remaining lectures in this series and then revisiting
                React. Simultaneously, I will be delving into Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, prioritizing the
                latter to maintain a swift pace of progress.
                <br>
                I would like to express my gratitude to all those who have followed my journey and offered their
                support. I look forward to sharing further updates with you soon!

            <p class="contentInPara">
                As of August 26th, I am excited to share a new update with you all. I have successfully created a music
                streaming web application called "Dhun" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project has been a
                valuable learning experience, and I have gained numerous insights along the way. It was a fun and
                rewarding endeavor.

                Furthermore, my college is set to resume on August 28th, and I have also participated in a team working
                on an ERP project within my college. I am eager to see how this project unfolds and contributes to my
                overall learning experience.

                Additionally, I recognize the importance of starting my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) journey as
                soon as possible, and I plan to prioritize it in the upcoming days.

                I want to express my appreciation to all of you for following my journey and offering your support. I
                look forward to sharing more updates with you in the near future!

                As of September 8th, I am delighted to share another update on my ongoing journey. I have completely
                revamped my About Me website, transforming it into a portfolio website that showcases my work and
                accomplishments. I drew inspiration from the design created by Avinash, a software developer featured on
                the GreatStack YouTube channel. While the website is nearly perfect for PCs, I am actively working on
                making it responsive for mobile phones.

                <br> <br>
                Additionally, I have initiated my journey into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) under the guidance
                of LuvBabbar bhaiya. I am pleased to report that I can independently solve LeetCode and CodeStudio
                problems featured in the first ten lectures of his playlist, which primarily focus on C++ concepts. As I
                progress into the eleventh lecture and beyond, which delve into DSA questions, I am optimistic about my
                ability to tackle them successfully.

                I want to express my gratitude to all of you for following my journey and offering your support. I look
                forward to sharing more updates with you in the near future!

            <p class="contentInPara">
                Well hello guys! Its been long time no see! Sorry, I couldn't update this blog section in recent times, was occupied in many other stuffs. like since last update
                I have successfully started many things andfinished a few too! <br>
                1) I finished 85% of the Chai aur Javascript playlist by none other than Hitesh Choudhary. <br>
                2) I finally choose a platform to study DSA coompletely, and its GFG's course by none other than Sandeep Jain. Completed 6 modules (uptil searching). <br>
                3) Started Chai aur React, and Chai aur backend playlists Simultaneously, but focusing on React first! Completed till L6 in Backend and till L11 in React. Ofcourse none other than Hitesh Choudhary! <br>
                See, after studying Java Script in depth from this playlist called ‚ÄúChai aur Javascript‚Äù taught by none other than
                Hitesh Choudhary, I worked on some basic projects, about which I talked previously too, like :-<br> <br>
                
                1) I completely renovated my landing page which acts as a portfolio cum blog page. <br>
                üîó <a class="GDSCpost" href="https://kharsh560.github.io/kh_aboutme.github.io/#myWork">My Portfolio</a>  <br>
                
                2) I made this music streaming app, having all the important functions whose logic I designed myself. <br>
                üîó <a class="GDSCpost" href="https://kharsh560.github.io/dhun_Feel_the_Music_BY_Kumar_Harsh/">Dhun</a><br>
                
                3) Made this game called "Guess the Number" as a part of the hands-on project by Hitesh Choudhary. <br>
                üîó <a class="GDSCpost" href="https://kharsh560.github.io/GuessTheNumberBy_KumarHarsh/">Guess the Number</a>  <br>
                
                4) Made a Dice game for tossing purposes. <br>
                üîó <a class="GDSCpost" href="https://kharsh560.github.io/dicee_game_by_kumar_harsh/">Dice game</a><br>
                
                5) Made a Drumkit as a part of the hands-on project by Angela Yu. <br>
                üîó <a class="GDSCpost" href="https://kharsh560.github.io/Drumkit_by_kumar_harsh.github.io/">Drum Kit</a> <br> <br>
                
                Then, I took part in some hackathons wherein I explored the MERN stack, but with a different pedagogy, that is
                "Implementing, then studying in-depth". So I worked on multiple projects on MERN without studying concepts in-depth
                initially. It was just documentation, some reference videos, and 'implementation' along with a blurry knowledge of the
                logic behind them. <br>
                
                Anyway, as a major project to explore MERN, I implemented a full-fledged one-to-one chat app based on MERN stack with
                the help of a playlist by Piyush Agarwal. <br>
                Doing so, I got to know the "overall flow" of how these technologies work. <br>
                
                Now, I am doing "Backend" and "React" on the channel "Chai aur Code" by the amazing tutor, Hitesh Choudhary.
                Yes, I am able to do both of these together because I now have a very clear Idea of how things work. Now I am looking
                for the "Why" aspect of it. Even, I feel that after having hands-on experience with these technologies, I am able to
                grasp things faster and with much relatability, which goes missing with the other path of "studying, then implementing". <br>
                
                Also, most recently, I got to explore Google's Gemini. I integrated it into our project Sync-Sphere where I trained it
                to act as a virtual assistant in chatbot format, solving the queries of the users related to our platform. <br>
                
                So, yeah, this is it. About my latest work. I will now keep posting my milestones regularly in this Blog section. <br>
                Also, I have posted about this on my <a class="GDSCpost" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kumar-harsh-468a22253_hello-folks-having-been-inspired-by-the-activity-7170155336438403072-jjyA?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop">Linkedin</a>  too,  so do check it out too. <br>
                <br>

                Today, I am going to share two of my team's achievements! <br> <br>
                I along with my team members Abhyuday Pratap Singh, Aditya Jaiswal and Akhilesh Malik, am excited to share our
                experiences from two major events: <br> <br>
                1) The Hackathon PitchTemberFest at the National Institute of Technology , Patna, and 2) The Google Solution Challenge
                2024 (GDSC), which were held in December and February respectively! <br> <br>
                
                #1 At PitchTemberFest, we had the privilege of engaging with inspiring founders and securing a spot in the
                hashtag#Top10, gaining valuable insights that shaped our project profoundly. <br> <br>
                
                #2 In the Google Solution Challenge, we elevated our project by integrating Google products like Gemini, enabling
                personalized responses for tax benefits based on income. Although we didn't make it to the hashtag#Top100, presenting
                our project was a significant milestone. We also received recognition by being shortlisted for the GDSC India regional
                Bootcamp, where we received personalized mentorship from Google Developers. <br> <br>
                
                About our project:- <br>
                Our project, Sync Sphere, addresses the disconnect between companies willing to give back, NGOs in need of funding, and
                individuals wanting to contribute to social causes. <br>
                Our primary focus is on SDG Goal 17 - Partnership of Goals. Sync Sphere acts as a centralized platform that simplifies
                CSR funding, provides diverse project opportunities, and engages volunteers for maximum social impact. <br> <br>
                
                Key Features of Sync Sphere:- <br>
                Key features of Sync Sphere include Gemini Chatbot Integration for personalized tax benefits calculation, the ability
                for NGOs and individuals to create and publish projects, seamless PayPal payment integration for easy contributions,
                swift access to CSR documents for companies evaluating projects, and the option for NGOs to accept or reject funding
                from companies based on their interests. <br> <br>
                
                While our journey with Sync Sphere didn't land us in the Top 100, the experience of building it has been incredibly
                rewarding and educational. Sync Sphere is still in development, and if you share our passion for social impact, we'd
                love to connect and collaborate! <br> <br>

                Hello guys, I am here to share a quick update on my React playlist! I have made three basic, but awesome and conceptually important projects on React using 
                concepts like React Hooks, React Custom Hooks, React Components, UseEffect Hook, React Props and much more. All these concepts have been covered in just 
                11 out of 34 lectures by Hitesh in his Chai aur React playlist. <br>
                 So it would be fun to see what next lecture have to offer! <br> <br>

            <p class="contentInPara">
                Hello people! Posting after a long time! <br>
                You know, apart from this public building trend, I had been noticing the trend of flaunting one‚Äôs success stories too,
                be it regarding internship or jobs. <br>
                
                So, here‚Äôs mine! I mean, why not if I have one? üòâ <br>
                
                I got my first internship, a paid one from a stealth startup based remotely!
                It was 25th August, 2024 when the final catchup discussion meet took place and both parties agreed upon to work
                together. <br>
                
                Didn't even realize, it‚Äôs been 4 months (September-December)! <br>
                Indeed, as they say, time slips through, eluding our grasp! <br>
                
                How was it, Harsh? <br>
                Well, lots of learning, lots of grinding, and tonnes of hard work was put in.‚Ä® <br>
                Any difficulties? ‚Ä®Hell yeah! Managing this internship, DSA, non-stop learning, my technical society‚Äôs tasks (not
                everyday, but it is when it is), and last but not the least the college‚Äôs practicals, assignments, mid-sems, end-sems,
                viva, and maintaining attendance has been like juggling multiple balls at once. <br>
                
                Now, also talking about the people behind the startup. ‚Ä®They are just amazing, fair, are having a great experience in
                top MNCs and most importantly are calm (hard to get, am lucky in this part). <br>
                
                What am I working on? <br>
                I‚Äôm working majorly in three domains, they are, full stack development (NEXT + MEN) , LLM prompt engineering (in order
                to mould the model to do a task perfectly all by itself, essentially automating it), and lastly, some hidden tasks (ofc
                can‚Äôt speak in public regarding this one üòÖ) <br>
                
                So! This was it, enough showcasing. <br>
                Lastly, I want to add, just keep going on, everyone has their own trajectory, own speeds and own capabilities, but the
                "result" is what matters. Keep learning, keep applying, keep failing, keep repeating! As you all know, it's majorly a
                luck game for those who have done all the hard work. Hence, never stop.
                Keeping your phones down and spend hours sitting and coding for your own benefit. Only this will work, nothing else. All
                these regular partying, gathering, watching reels for hours won't help none! <br>
                
                Wishing you all good luck for your ‚ÄúThe first story‚Äù and wish me one too as there‚Äôs a long journey to cover. <br>
                
                Lastly thanking @Hiteshdotcom @CodeWithHarry1 @Piyush_eon @lovebabbar3 @Luvk1412 ... for this!

                <br>
                Thankyou for reading the blog, Its Harsh signing off, hope to see you in my next blog!
